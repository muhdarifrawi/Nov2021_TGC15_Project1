# Weather Forecasting and Historical Data Search Website

## Preface
This webpage was created for users to be able to look at the predicted forecasts in Singapore. It's created for casual usage and not for professionally logging of weather data. It can also be used for educational purposes though most data is incomplete and needs further investigation. 

The website was created with ease of access in mind. A simple navigation bar to show the different pages of the site. Cards to display weather forecast, icons to show current weather location and graphs of different colors.

This webpage is intended to be Open Source and is open for any developers to take inspiration from it or add-on to it. 

The initial idea was to create a forecasting global map with its relevant historial data. After much research for the relevant datasets, that was deemed an Icarus-level goal due to the timeline set for this project.
